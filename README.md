# Whistle

This assignment displays working knowledge of two NPM packages (express & mysql)
and also the process of communicating with a database. The user interface takes place
entirely inside of the console, and it emulates the process of querying the Google Maps API
to return the user's location and send that to up to five friends.

In order to download and run this program on your machine, you must run "npm install". This will ensure
that all of the correct modules are installed. Please contact the development team if there are 
any other issues or changes that you'd like to see. Thanks!
