# Whistle

This application allows you to press a single button when you are in an emergency and alert your friends
in the area. This app uses HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, Express, Body-Parser, and many other technologies, and we think that it would be best used on a mobile device. It was built over the course of roughly two weeks by students at the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp.
